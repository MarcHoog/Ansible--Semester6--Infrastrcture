# Ansible
This repository is for my own ansible playbooks and things I create using ansible!. 

Some of these will be depended on other repository's like my webhook repository. 

I mostly just enjoy making these things, for school and in my free time. Ansible is pretty dope!

And Python is also really cool, SSH is my best friend you get it... 

I will Update this readme one day with a propper readme... If there is one thing that i should do is like update
all my repo's with a proper readme cause like non of them have a proper one. Hehe!
